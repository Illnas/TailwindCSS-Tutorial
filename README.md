TailwindCSS Tutorial

I applied for another frontend dev job, and they were using TailwindCSS, so I took this opportunity to learn it.
I mean, I did not get the job, but still, knowing Tailwind is useful.

As such, what is my opinion of it? It's similar to bootstrap, and therefore good when you don't want to
or don't have time to bother with CSS. Would I switch from Sass to Tailwind? Nope! But I will continue to use it for project here and there.

This was done with tutorial from Traversy Media.

Next tutorial is Redux (again), and this time I will do simple counter project with Tailwind.

Onwards to another project!
